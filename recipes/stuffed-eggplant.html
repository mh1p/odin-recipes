    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This delicious stuffed eggplant with a cheesy top is a must-try recipe! Great as a hearty main but you can buy the mini eggplants and use them for a side dish or appetizer.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (1 1/2 pound) eggplant, halved lengthwise</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 pound sweet Italian sausage, casings removed</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
            <li>1 cup tomato-basil pasta sauce</li>
            <li>3/4 cup Italian seasoned panko bread crumbs, divided</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil.</li>
            <li>Cut around the edge of the flesh in each eggplant half using a sharp paring knife, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Scoop out flesh using a spoon, leaving 1/2-inch-thick shell; reserve flesh and chop into bite-size pieces.</li>
            <li>Brush shells with 2 tablespoons olive oil and season with salt and pepper; set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large, deep skillet over medium high heat. Add sausage, onion, mushrooms, and garlic; cook and stir until sausage is evenly brown. Stir in reserved chopped eggplant and basil. Add pasta sauce; cook and stir for 5 minutes. Mix in 1/2 cup of panko and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Stuff mixture into eggplant shells. Combine remaining panko and cheese in a small bowl; sprinkle over stuffing.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until eggplant is tender, 45 to 50 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
